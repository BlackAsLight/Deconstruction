# Deconstruction

Deconstruction is a mod made for Factorio. When miners run out of resources to mine, they get marked for deconstruction.

## Chests

Chests receiving input directly from miners can be auto marked for deconstruction. This can be toggled on and off within the mod's settings, and is off by default. When toggled on, and the chest loses its last miner inserting directly into it, it will have a minimum of 10mins to empty itself, or it won't get marked for deconstruction.

## Belts, Underground Belts and Splitters

Belts receiving input directly from miners can be auto marked for deconstruction. This can be toggled on and off within the mod's settings, and is off by default. When toggled on and if the belt has no other belts inserting into it, then when it loses its last miner inserting directly into it, it will have a minimum of 1min to empty itself, or it won't get marked for deconstruction.
