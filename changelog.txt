Version: 2.0.0

    - Re-wrote everything to be better.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
  New:
    - Added a bunch of comments to the code denoting the logic at hand and how it works.
    - Made it so if other mods add new entities of prototype mining-drill, with a radius larger than 3 will also work properly. (Hopefully)
  Changed:
    - Moved some checks happening at the start of the game instead of every time it checks an entity. Because it only had to run once.
